# System-Analysis

The client for this project was DriverPass, a company wishing to train students on how to drive. The client wanted the system to offer different driving packages to the customers, with the system being up to date on the latest DMV rules and convenient for the customer to schedule driving appointments and take online tests. The one part of the document I wish I could have improved on is the UML class diagram, as I feel it lacks sufficient information more than I would like. The one thing I feel I did the best on is the UML sequence diagrams, especially the login one. For these documents I learned a lot about taking into account the different features needing to go into a program (security, payment processes, etc.) and taking into account a cliets needs and making the diagrams helps by providing a visual representation of what the client wants, also helping to go over and breakdown each feature before going into coding.
